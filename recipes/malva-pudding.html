    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h5>For the Sponge Cake</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>6 1⁄2 ounces sugar (3/4 cup, 200 ml, or 180 g)</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon apricot jam</li>
      <li>5 ounces all-purpose flour (150 g)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1⁄2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter (a generous tablespoon)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vinegar</li>
      <li>1⁄3 cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>For The Sauce</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>3⁄4 cup fresh cream (200 ml)</li>
      <li>3 1⁄2 ounces butter (100 g)</li>
      <li>3 -5 ounces sugar (90 - 150 g)</li>
      <li>1⁄3 cup hot water (90 ml)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla essence</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Directions:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 deg F/180 deg Celsius. Adjust accordingly.</li>
      <li>Grease an oven dish. </li>
      <li>Beat or whip the sugar and eggs.</li>
      <li>Beat until thick and lemon coloured, then add the jelly (jam) and mix through.</li>
      <li>Melt the butter (don't boil) and add the butter and vinegar</li> to the wet mixture.
      <li>Sieve, or simply mix together: the flour, soda and salt.</li>
      <li>Add this mixture with the milk to the egg mixture in the processor or mixing bowl. Beat well.</li>
      <li>Pour into an oven-proof dish and bake until pudding is brown and well-risen -- depending on your oven and oven dish this will be between 30 - 45 minutes. (Mine was done in 30 minutes this time).</li>
      <li>In a pot, melt together the ingredients for the sauce, and stir well.</li>
      <li>Pour it over the pudding as soon as it comes out of the oven.</li>
      <li>Leave to stand awhile before serving. Serve warm. Because it's rich it does not really need enhancement, but if you want, serve with vanilla ice cream.</li>
